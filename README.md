# Jakarta-Apartment
report version : https://bit.ly/portfolio_jalal_apartment

This is my individual project about apartment in Jabodetabek ( Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi ). The goals are:
- Identify what things that have a linear relationship with annual price
- Create a regression model to predict the price

The resources of this project come from "jendela360.com" ( last updated 6 Jan 2022 )

After scraping their website, I split the analyzing process into two parts: cleaning and modeling. So, you can see each of them in a different notebook
Hopefully, this one can bring some ideas for you and feel free to let me know if you have any feedback :)
