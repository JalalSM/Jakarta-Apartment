# Jakarta-Apartment
This is my individual project about apartment in Jabodetabek ( Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi ). The goals are:
- Identify what things that have a significant effect on apartment price
- Create a regression model to predict the price

I got this data from scraping "jendela360.com" and created two parts for this project, you can see the cleaning and modelling process in different notebook.

Hopefully, this one can bring some ideas for you and feel free to let me know if you have any feedback :)
